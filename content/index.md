This is where my notes live. It is an ever-growing garden of thoughts, ideas, and musings about my interests. I sometimes #Blog about things on my mind, or other miscellaneous topics. I may eventually post updates about my #Travel, although nothing exists there yet. I often keep notes about #Physics, #Math, and #Coding for later reference. The "knowledge network" shows connectivity map of my notes. Click the upper-right button to expand the graph to show the connections between all of my notes. Feel free to look around!
