Welcome to my **Digital Garden** — an ever-evolving collection of ideas and exploratory writing. Unlike a traditional blog, this space thrives on spontaneity and creative exploration. I craft my notes in **Obsidian** using markdown and transform them into this interactive web experience with the use of **Quartz 4**.

Here, you’ll find occasional #Blog posts on musings and miscellaneous topics, alongside a treasure trove of notes on #Physics, #Math, and #Coding meant for future reference. I might also share updates on #Travel someday, though that journey is just beginning.

Explore the “knowledge network” — a dynamic connectivity map that reveals the relationships between all my notes. Simply click the button in the upper right to expand the graph and uncover the rich tapestry of ideas. I've put together a Spotify playlist of some of the more-atmospheric songs I often listen to while I'm doing work. You can listen to that playlist from the Spotify widget!

Enjoy your journey through this garden of thought!
