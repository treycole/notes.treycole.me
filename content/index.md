Welcome to my **Digital Garden** — an ever-evolving collection of ideas and exploratory writing. Unlike a traditional blog, this space thrives on spontaneity and creative exploration. I craft my notes in **Obsidian** using markdown and transform them into this interactive web experience with the use of **Quartz 4**.

Here, you’ll find occasional #Blog posts on musings and miscellaneous topics, alongside a collection of notes on #Physics, #Math, and #Coding. I might also share updates on #Travel someday.

Explore the “knowledge network” — a dynamic connectivity map that reveals the relationships between all my notes. Simply click the button in the upper right to expand the graph and uncover the rich tapestry of ideas. Enjoy your journey through this garden of thought!

> [!warning] Disclaimer
>  Some of these notes are from textbooks or sources I have not yet cited. I will try to add citations as I go.
