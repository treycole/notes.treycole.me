A group $\mathcal{G}$ is a set of distinct elements $G_1, \cdots, G_g$ s.t. for any two elements $G_i$ and $G_j$ there is a binary operation $*$ called group multiplication that satisfies the following four axioms
1.  The set $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under multiplication.
	- $G_i,\ G_j$ $\in \mathcal{G} \rightarrow G_i * G_j$ $\in \mathcal{G}$ 
2. Associativity
	- $G_k * (G_i * G_j) = (G_k * G_i) * G_j$
3. $\exists$ identity $\in \mathcal{G}$ 
	- $E * G_i = G_i$ 
4. $\exists$ inverse $\forall\ G \in \mathcal{G}$  
	- $G_i^{-1} G_i = E$ 
The total number of elements of a group is called the _order_ of the group. The order can be either finite or infinite. 

A group is said to be _Abelian_ if the group elements commute,
5. Commutativity $\forall \ G_i, G_j \in\mathcal{G}$ 
	- $G_i G_j = G_j G_i$ 
otherwise it is _non-Abelian_. 

Let $G$ be an element of the group $\mathcal{G}$, the smallest integer $p$ such that $G^p = E$ is called the order of element $G$.

### Representations
Consider the abstract elements $G$ of a group $\mathcal{G}$, and another set of elements $\hat{G}$ in a group $\hat{\mathcal{G}}$. If every element $G$ has has a one to one correspondence with $\hat{G}$ then the groups $\hat{\mathcal{G}}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are isomorphic, then $\hat{\mathcal{G}}$ is called a _representation_ of $\mathcal{G}$.
