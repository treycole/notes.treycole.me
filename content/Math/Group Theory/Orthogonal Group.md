The set of matrices that are orthogonal, or 
$$
O O^T = \mathbb{1}
$$
forms a group. We can see this by first analyzing the determinant property of orthogonal matrices,
$$
\text{det}(O) = \pm 1
$$
which can be seen by the orthogonality condition and properties of determinants. An orthogonal matrix whose determinant is $+1$ is called _proper_ and represents rotations, while a matrix whose determinant is $-1$ is called _improper_ and represents mirror operations.
