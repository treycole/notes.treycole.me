### Twisted Bilayer Graphene
Two sheets of graphene that are rotated relative to each other. Graphene has two sublattices $A$ and $B$ , and forms a honeycomb lattice. High symmetry points in the BZ are denoted by $\Gamma$ at the center and $K$/$K'$ at the edge of the BZ that are related by TRS.

Low energy effective (Dirac) Hamiltonian. $$ H_{\tau}(\vec{p}) = v_F (\tau p_x \sigma_x + p_y \sigma_y)$$
Breaking $C_2$ symmetry will gap the Dirac points, generating Berry curvature. Berry flux of $\pi$ and $-\pi$ in conduction and valence bands respectively. To generate Chern bands, need TRS breaking Haldane mass.
#### Moire periodicity
Period is much larger than single layer. 
- AA stacking
- BA stacking
- AB Stacking
Momenta related by a Moire reciprocal lattice vector are equivalent. Mixing between different layers. 

Moire bands will be folded. Spin and valley 'flavors'. Filling factor $\nu$ measures number of electrons per moire unit cell. 
#### Flat bands and magic angle
Layers decoupled will have Dirac points at $K'_M$ and $K_M$. They will intercept at $\approx 100$ meV between the Dirac points. Results in avoided crossings with magnitude of roughly the interlayer hopping $t_{\perp} \approx 100 meV$. This will flatten the bands sinc the energy scales match. Correlation effects occur because of band flatness.

Dirac points remain, and they have the same winding number. Apply sublattice mass $\sigma_z$ and the Dirac points will gap, further flattening the bands, and generating opposite Chern numbers for  lower and upper bands.

#### Bistritzer-MacDonald model
$$H_K^{BM}(\vec{k}, \vec{k}') = \begin{pmatrix}v_F (\vec{k} - \vec{K}_D^{(1)})\cdot\sigma & T(\vec{k}, \vec{k}') \\ T^{\dagger} & v_F(k - K_D^{(2)})\cdot\sigma\end{pmatrix}$$
with $T$ being interlayer hopping.

#### Superconductivity 
At low temperatures, certain angles, and for certain densities (filling), can have superconducting phases. 
#### Unknowns
- How do phonons affect the Moire material?
- Twist angle disorder
- Chiral ratio/modelling (gap from other bands)
#### Incommensurate Kekule spiral
- IKS dominates all non-zero integers with strain
- explains (semi) metallic behavior at $\nu = 0,1$
