Anyons have fractional statistics and charge, and are thought to be a possible ingredient in the creation of topological quantum computers. By braiding their world lines, the non-Abelian exchange statistics can encode quantum information.
## Fractional Statistics and Charge
- Bosons even upon exchange $P \Psi(x_1, x_2) = \Psi (x_2, x_1)$
- Fermions odd upon exchange $P\Psi(x_1, x_2) = -\Psi(x_2, x_1)$ 
- Anyons have fractional statistics upon exchange  $P\Psi(x_1, x_2) = e^{i\theta} \Psi(x_2, x_1)$

	- Composites formed from charged particles and vortices in (2+1)-dimensional models, or flux tubes in three-dimensional models, can have any (fractional) angular momentum
	- The statistics of these objects, like their spin, interpolates continuously between the usual boson and fermion cases.
	- Although practical applications of these phenomena seem remote, I think they have considerable methodological interest and shed light on fundamental spin-statistics connection

## Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
- IQHE have plateaus at integer filling $\nu = n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
- Plateaus and fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ where $p/q$ is a rational fraction
- Quasi particles carry fractional charge $e* = \nu e$ 
- Braiding statistics $\theta_{anyon} = 2\pi \frac{e^*}{e}$  
#### Fabry-Perot Interferometry

$$
I \propto |t_1|^2 + |t_2|^2 + |t_1||t_2|\cos\theta 
$$
- In integer QHE phase $$
\theta = 2\pi \frac{AB}{\phi_0},  \quad \phi_0 = \frac{h}{e}
$$
- In FQHE phase $$\theta = 2\pi \frac{AB}{\phi_0} \frac{e}{e^*} + N_L\theta_{anyon}$$
	- We expect to see phase slips if there is an anyon bound within the interference region
- Problem: Strong bulk-edge coupling will shrink effective area of interference region via Coulomb interaction with edge mode and bound charges. This will result in lines of positive barber shop pole slope in $\beta \delta V$  versus $BA/\Phi_0$
	- Can be in different regimes (Aharanov Bohm $\rightarrow$ Coulomb) depending on the stiffness 
	- Occurs in small devices (increasing charging energy)
	- Increasing size goes toward AB regime, but lose coherence
	- Solution, sandwich 2DEG between capacitor (screening well heterostructure with top and bottom gating) $\rightarrow$ quench charging energy
	- Now, strong and highly coherent AB interference in integer and fractional regimes observed
