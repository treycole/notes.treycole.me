A space group is the symmetry [[Groups|group]] of a repeating pattern in space. The elements of the space group are the rigid transformations that leave the pattern unchanged. The point groups are $\subset$ of the space groups. The set of all point groups and translations form the space groups.
### Symmorphic 
A space group is called 'symmorphic' if, apart from lattice rotations, all generating symmetry operations leave one common point fixed. Thus, only point-group operations are permitted: rotations, reflections, inversions, and rotoinversions. 
### Herman-Maugin Space Group Symbol
The HM space group symbol can be derived from the symmetry elements present using the following logic.

The first letter (lattice descriptor) identifies the centering of the lattice
- P: Primitive
- I : Body-centered
- F: Face-centered
- C: C-centered
- B: B-centered
- A: A-centered

The next three symbols denote the symmetry elements present in certain directions
