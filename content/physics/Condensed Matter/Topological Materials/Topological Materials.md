Until recently, the standard paradigm for understanding phases of matter was through Landau's symmetry breaking theory and order parameters. An example being a ferromagnet after being cooled through its Curie temperature, below which there is a reduction of rotational symmetry and the appearance of an order parameter, the magnetization. 

However, there exists certain types of phases of matter that do not exhibit any symmetry differences, and no order parameter, that differs from its trivial phase. The distinction lies in the topology of their Hamiltonians. During a topological phase transition, the Hamiltonians on both sides of the phase can no longer be continuously connected without closing the energy gap. By definition, the trivial phase is that which can be adiabatically connected to the atomic limit, where the material consists of non-interacting atoms. 
## Topological Insulators

Materials whose states exhibit a variety of physical phenomena can be classified as topological insulators.

- Chiral charge = Chern number
#### Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator
- The first kind of topological state identified
- Theoretical prediction by Thouless, Haldane, and others in the late 1980s as a possible 2D insulating state exhibiting quantized Hall conductance 
- Typically needs a large magnetic field, however, in Haldane's mode, where he introduced complex next nearest neighbor hopping in honeycomb lattice to break time-reversal symmetry, no magnetic field is needed. The term "anomalous" comes from the fact that we have Hall conductance without magnetic field.
#### Quantum Spin Hall Insulator
- Predicted by Kane & Mele (2005), and Fu and Kane (2006) as a class of 2D nonmagnetic spin Hall insulators whose Bloch states are topologically twisted
- Occurs when the charge hall conductance is zero, but the spin hall conductance is non-zero and takes quantized values
#### 3D nonmagnetic insulators
- The identification of "weak" and "strong" topological insulators by Fu et. al (2007), and Moore and Balents (2007)
#### Topological Crystalline Insulators
