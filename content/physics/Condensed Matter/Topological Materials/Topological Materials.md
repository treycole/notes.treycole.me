Until recently, the standard paradigm for understanding phases of matter was through Landau's symmetry breaking theory and order parameters. A classic example being a _ferromagnet_, which, after being cooled through its Curie temperature there is a reduction of rotational symmetry and the appearance of an order parameter, the magnetization. 

Yet, not all phases of matter conform to this paradigm. There exist exotic states that exhibit **no change in symmetry**, **no local order parameter**, and yet are **fundamentally distinct** from trivial phases. The key to their identity lies in **topology** — a global property of their quantum ground state. In such systems, **topological phase transitions** involve a fundamental restructuring of the Hamiltonian, such that one phase **cannot be smoothly deformed into another without closing the energy gap**.

Some cornerstone examples of topological materials are 
- [[Chern Insulator]]
- [[Topological Insulators]] 
- [[Topological Semimetals]]
- [[Topological Crystalline Insulators]]
- Topological Superconductors

More recently, topology has emerged in diverse contexts — from **magnetic skyrmions** to **topological spin liquids**, revealing a rich interplay between geometry, entanglement, and quantum matter.
