Until recently, the standard paradigm for understanding phases of matter was through Landau's symmetry breaking theory and order parameters. An example being a ferromagnet after being cooled through its Curie temperature, below which there is a reduction of rotational symmetry and the appearance of an order parameter, the magnetization. 

However, there exists certain types of phases of matter that do not exhibit any symmetry differences, and no order parameter, that differs from its trivial phase. The distinction lies in the topology of their Hamiltonians. During a topological phase transition, the Hamiltonians on both sides of the phase can no longer be continuously connected without closing the energy gap. By definition, the trivial phase is that which can be adiabatically connected to the atomic limit, where the material consists of non-interacting atoms. 

Some traditional examples of topological materials are 
- [[Chern Insulator]]
- [[Topological Insulators]] - usually what is meant by "topological insulator"
- [[Topological Semimetals]]
- [[Topological Crystalline Insulators]]
- Topological Superconductors

In recent research, topology appears in various places, such as skyrmions, topological spin liquids, etc.
