Cousin of TIs

__Structure property relation__ 
- Materials made out of chemically similar elements arranged in same crystal structure have similar electronic properties
	- e.g. Si, Ge, and Diamond all made of group 4 elements and have same crystal structure. All three are insulators with band gap of order of 1 eV
- Are there exceptions?

__Ask__: Are there topologically distinct states with the same crystal structure? Are there topologically non-trivial states protected by crystal symmetry instead of TRS?
- symmetry examples: rotation, spin-rotation, reflection ...
- Yes. 

__Tin Telluride: First TCI__
- In 2012 first realization of topological crystalline insulators found in Tin Telluride (SnTe), a binary compound with rocksalt crystal structure 
- Conversely, lead telluride is non-topological with same crystal structure
- Tin telluride is predicted to have topologically protected surface states while lead telluride does not. The topological protection comes from the _mirror symmetry_
- Experimental groups observed surface states in tin telluride
- These surface states open a band gap on a structural distortion that breaks the mirror symmetry

_Summary_: Topological surface states protected by crystal symmetry a property unique to topological crystalline insulators
