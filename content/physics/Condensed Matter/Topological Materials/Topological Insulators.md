 Predicted by Kane & Mele (2005), and Fu and Kane (2006) as a class of 2D nonmagnetic spin Hall insulators whose Bloch states are topologically twisted. Occurs when the charge hall conductance is zero, but the spin hall conductance is non-zero and takes quantized values. Gapless surface states come in pairs guaranteed by Kramer's degeneracy in the presence of TRS.
