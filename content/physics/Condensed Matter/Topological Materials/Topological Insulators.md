 Predicted by Kane & Mele (2005), and Fu and Kane (2006) as a class of 2D nonmagnetic spin Hall insulators whose Bloch states are topologically twisted. Occurs when the charge hall conductance is zero, but the spin hall conductance is non-zero and takes quantized values. Gapless surface states come in pairs guaranteed by Kramer's degeneracy in the presence of TRS.

### Kane-Mele Model

With spinâ€“orbit coupling, graphene can support edge states forming a QSH insulator, protected by time-reversal symmetry.

##### Tight-binding model
Fu-Kane-Mele model for 3D topological insulator on a diamond lattice
$$H_{FKM} = \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} t_{ij} c^{\dagger}_i c_j + i \frac{4 \lambda_{SO}}{a^2} \sum_{\langle\langle i j \rangle \rangle} c^{\dagger}_i \sigma \cdot (\mathbf{d}^1_{ij} \times \mathbf{d}^2_{ij}) c_j $$
