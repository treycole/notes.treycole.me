 Predicted by Kane & Mele (2005), and Fu and Kane (2006) as a class of 2D nonmagnetic spin Hall insulators whose Bloch states are topologically twisted. Occurs when the charge hall conductance is zero, but the spin hall conductance is non-zero and takes quantized values. Gapless surface states come in pairs guaranteed by Kramer's degeneracy in the presence of TRS.

### Kane-Mele Model

With spinâ€“orbit coupling, graphene can support edge states forming a QSH insulator, protected by time-reversal symmetry.
