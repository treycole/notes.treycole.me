The first kind of topological state identified by Thouless, Haldane, and others in the late 1980s. A Chern insulator is a class of materials that exhibit a quantum Hall effect in the absence of a magnetic field, making it "anomalous". 

An early model of such a material was introduced by Haldane. He proposed a tight-binding model where flux quanta were introduced "by hand" through a complex second nearest neighbor hopping term. This term breaks time-reversal symmetry, and allows the system to exhibit a ground state with a non-zero Chern number.

 The manifestation of the Chern number in 2D is that the Berry phase winds along BZ in one k direction ($k_x$) as a function of the other  ($k_y$). Another observable consequence is that there are gapless surface states creating a chiral edge channel around the sample.
