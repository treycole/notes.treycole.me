A Chern insulator is a class of materials that exhibit an anomalous quantum Hall effect, a quantized Hall conductance in the absence of a magnetic field. 

An early model of such a material was introduced by Haldane. He proposed a tight-binding model where flux quanta were introduced "by hand" through a complex second nearest neighbor hopping term. This term breaks time-reversal symmetry, and allows the system to exhibit a ground state with a non-zero Chern number. The model is
$$
    \begin{split}
     H = &\ \Delta \sum_i (-)^{i} c_i^{\dagger} c_i -t_1 \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} (c_i^{\dagger}c_j + h.c.) + t_2 \sum_{\langle\langle i, j \rangle\rangle} (i c_i^{\dagger}c_j +h.c. ) 
    \end{split}
$$
The global invariance of the Chern number introduces an equivalence class of insulators characterized by the Chern number of their ground state. Insulators whose occupied states have a net  $C\neq 0$ have become known as "_Chern insulators_", while insulators with $C=0$ are called trivial. This model became the first example of a Chern insulator, launching the systematic investigation of topological materials.

 The manifestation of the Chern number in 2D is that the Berry phase winds along BZ in one k direction ($k_x$) as a function of the other  ($k_y$). Another observable consequence is that there are gapless surface states creating a chiral edge channel around the sample.
