A semimetal is a material with very small overlap between bottom of conduction band and top of valence band. They have no band gap, but a negligible density of states at the Fermi level.

In a semimetal the bottom of the conduction band is typically situated in a different part of of the BZ than the top of the valence band.  
### Typical Semimetals

The classic semimetals are 
- Arsenic (As)
- Antimony (Sb)
- Bismuth
- $\alpha$ - Tin (gray tin)
- Graphite
