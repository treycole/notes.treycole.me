Physics theories are judged on their predictive power. Classical mechanics relies on Newton's second law to predict the future of a particles' motion. The ability to predict the quantum future started with Erwin Schrödinger and bears his name.

The time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the differential equation
$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}\ket{\psi(t)} = H(t)\ket{\psi(t)}
$$
where the operator $H$ corresponds to the total energy of the system and is called the __Hamiltonian__ operator of the system because it is derived from the classical Hamiltonian. This equation is known as the __Schrödinger equation__.
