[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_group)
In geometry, a point group is a mathematical group of symmetry operations (isometries in a Euclidean space) that have a fixed point in common. The coordinate origin of the Euclidean space is conventionally taken to be a fixed point, and every point group in dimension $d$ is then a subgroup of the orthogonal group $O(d)$.

Each point group can be represented as sets of orthogonal matrices $M$ that transform a point $x$ into point $y$ by $y = Mx$. Each element is either a rotation ($det(M) = 1$) or a reflection / improper rotation ($det(M)=-1$) .
### Chiral and achiral point groups, reflection groups
Point groups can be classified into _chiral_ (purely rotational) groups and _achiral_ groups. Chiral groups are subgroups of the special orthogonal group $SO(d)$, only orthogonal transformations of determinant $+1$. Achiral groups allow for determinant $-1$. 
## Crystallographic Point Groups
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_point_group#:~:text=In%20Schoenflies%20notation%2C%20point%20groups,to%20the%20axis%20of%20rotation.)
A crystallographic point group is a $d=3$ point group whose symmetry operations are compatible with a three-dimensional lattice. According to the crystallographic restriction it may only contain one-, two-, three-, four-, and sixfold rotations or rotoinversions (rotation + reflection). This reduces the number of crystallographic point groups from an $\infty$ of general point groups to 32. 

To each space group ([[Space Groups]]) is associated a crystallographic point group by forgetting the translational components of the symmetry operations. 
#### Notation
##### Schoenflies notation
In this notation, point groups are denoted by a letter symbol with a subscript
- $C_n$ (for cyclic)
	- group that has an n-fold rotation axis
- $C_{nh}$ 
	- $C_n$ + reflection plane perpendicular to axis of rotation
- $C_{nv}$ 
	- $C_n$ + mirror planes parallel to axis of rotation
- $S_{2n}$ (for Spiegel, German for mirror)
	- group with only a 2n-fold rotation-reflection axis
- $D_n$ (for dihedral, or two-sided)
	- group that has an n-fold rotation axis + n twofold axes perpendicular to that axis
- $D_{nh}$
	- $D_n$ + mirror plane perpendicular to $n$-fold axis
- $D_{nd}$
	- $D_n$ + mirror planes parallel to $n$-fold axis
