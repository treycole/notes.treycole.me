## Derivation
Starting with a picture of molecules bouncing around a container, as the molecule hits the wall with some force, it is reflected causing some pressure against the walls of the container. The definition of pressure is
$$
P = \frac{F}{A} \ \mathrm{[Pa]}
$$
with pressure in units of Pascals $\mathrm{[Pa]} = \mathrm{[N/m^2]}$, $F$ being the force, and $A$ being the pressure exerted on the wall. There must be some sense of how many molecules there are so we use the number of mols which is defined as
$$
N_{mols} = \frac{N}{N_{Av}}
$$
with $N_{Av} = 6.023\times10^{23}\ \ \mathrm{[\frac{{molecules}}{{mol}}]}$ being Avogadro's number and $N$ being the number of molecules in the container. The __ideal gas law__ can then be defined as
$$
PV = N_{mols}RT
$$
where $R = 8.314 \ \mathrm{[\frac{J}{mol\cdot K}]}$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $V$ is the volume of the container. This says as temperature rises, pressure rises.

Can make a simplification and define __Boltzmann's constant__
$$
k = \frac{R}{N_{Av}} = 1.3807\times10^{-23}\ \mathrm{[\frac{J}{K}]}
$$
making the ideal gas law that is typically used in Physics become
$$
PV = NkT
$$
$$
P = \frac{N}{V}kT
$$
$$
P = nkT
$$
where $n = \frac{N}{V}$ is the __number density__.
