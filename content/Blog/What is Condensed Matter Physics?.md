As my first blog post, I thought I would introduce the idea of condensed matter physics to a non-technical audience to give a sense of what I do. 

Research shows that the most common questions in early social interactions are those that aim to identify shared context, typically in the form of identity-establishing questions like

>[!question] What do you do?  

Usually when I am met with this type of question, I answer with some permutation of, "I study physics." A typical response is a puzzled look of confusion, or something like "that sounds difficult." Immediately, any hope of shared context is lost. 

To many, physics is just a mysterious, esoteric field that has seemingly little connection with their lives. To others, they may read about it on occasion, catch bits and pieces of information in the media. But at some point or another, we have all wondered about the world around us. Be it as a child learning how to operate our bodies in the physical world, or as an adult looking up at the stars in the night sky, pondering what lies beyond. From my perspective this is what physics is all about; understanding this "place" we exist in. 

So, what I aim to do in this post is share a bit about what I do. If you've stumbled upon this post as a non-physicist hopefully you will find it interesting, or if you are a physicist, maybe you can still enjoy my musings.

### Condensed Matter Physics

I am not going to attempt to provide an overview of the field of physics as a whole. That is an undertaking for another day. I would like to approach the more modest task of explaining its largest subfield, condensed matter physics. 

> [!question]  What is condensed matter physics?


The Wikipedia definition of condensed matter physics is:

> [!quote] Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter, especially in the solid and liquid phases, that arise from electromagnetic forces between atoms and electrons.

While this technically is an all-encompassing definition, it really doesn't give a feeling for what it means to study condensed matter physics. 

> [!question] Why do we study "condensed matter" at all? 

For one, it represents the overwhelming majority of the world around us. Metals, glass, water, wood, silicon, organic material, are all forms of "condensed matter" and play vastly varying and important roles in our lives. 

On a practical level, the study of solids has been a successful enterprise that has lead to the majority of technological advancements we have today. The building blocks of computers, the transistor, was developed within the domain of "condensed matter physics" at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey.

However, the most fascinating and, in my view, important reason is that it tells us about the universe. Ourselves, and the matter around us, are not exempt from the universe. The questions about the very nature of reality can be sequestered in the behaviors of rather mundane materials, and within us. The attitude of many physicists, and myself for the most part, is that we don't really care what practical uses our research has in the "real world." Of course, if your research happens to lead to revolutionary technology that makes the world a better place, all the better. But the reality is, most of the research we do only has implications within our narrow field of interests. It may influence other research projects within your domain, which influences others, and so on, which will hopefully accumulate to a better understanding of the world. The driving force for myself, and many others as far as I've gathered, is personal enlightenment and the art of doing science. Science is a beautiful symphony of minds coming together to create something where there wasn't before. This "something," in the end, reflects a truth about the nature of reality. However seemingly tiny that "something" is, the fact that it exists at all, and that we are able to find it, has grand implications. 

## A Brief History of Materials

The phrase "condensed matter physics" in fact was not coined until the late 1960s by Nobel Laureate Phillip Anderson. Our relationship to materials and matter goes back much further, and is inseparable from the human story. The ages of history are defined by human's ability to control and manipulate the matter around them. 

### Early History

Since the dawn of mankind, we used materials to improve our condition.

- __Paleolithic (28,000 - 12,000 BC)__ - In the Paleolithic era, we utilized sharp stone, flint, and wood, to protect ourselves from predators and the environment. This use of material gave us agency over our condition, and allowed the species to propagate. The use of ceramic objects soon became a means for food storage, and often served ritualistic purposes.
-  __Neolithic (10,000 - 3300 BC)__ - The Neolithic era brought the development of pottery, as well as early usage of glass production and metalworking.

Sometime around 8000 BC, human mastery of metals such as copper completely changed everything from agriculture and weaponry to architecture. 

- __Bronze Age (3300 - 1200 BC)__ -  Copper is a soft metal, and can be bent and hammered into useful shapes. However, it was too soft for large scale usefulness. The development of metallurgy to combine copper and tin allowed the creation of a more sturdy and useful bronze.
- __Iron Age (1200 - 300 BC)__ - The development of iron and steel replaced bronze, as iron was more naturally abundant and could be made stronger and less brittle.  

Around 600 BC, the human discovery of electricity and magnetism is first recorded. 

- __Magnetism (600 BC)__ - Iodestones containing magnetized pieces of magnetite were discovered to attract iron. The philosopher Thales of Miletus is thought to have been the first to scientifically discuss magnetism. The word "magnet" comes from Iodestons found in Magnesia, Anatolia.
- __Electricity (600 BC)__ - Thales of Miletus made observations that rubbing an amber rod creates static electricity. At the time, he believed the forces from the electricity were magnetic. In fact, electricity was noticed some time before, dating back to 2750 BC, in electric fish such as eels. 

Humans then begin postulating the existence of atoms

- __Atomism (400 BC)__ - Leucippus and Democritus postulate atomism

Around 100 AD, the behavior of light traveling through materials is observed

- __Optics (160 AD)__ - Ptolemy tabulated angles of refraction for light traveling through different media

### Early Modern History


%% 

In school, we all learn at some point that matter comes in three distinct phases: solids, liquids, and gasses. In our daily experience, these are the phases of matter that we interact with the most. Other, more exotic phases are sequestered in stars or laboratories. The form of matter that we are most familiar with are solids. The ground we stand on, the chair we sit on, the trees around us, the food we eat are all solids. What makes something solid? To understand the answer to this question, we must look at the microscopic arrangements of atoms in the material, and how they interact with each other. %%
