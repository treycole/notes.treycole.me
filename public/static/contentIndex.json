Suppose we learn the value of a random variable X. The Shannon entropy of X quantifies how much information we gain, on average, after we learn the value of X. Alternatively, the entropy of X measures the amount of uncertainty about X before we learn its value.\nThe entropy is a function of the probabilities of the different possible values of the random variable takes p_1, \\cdots, p_n. The Shannon entropy associated with this probability distribution is defined by H(X)\\equiv H(p_1, \\cdots, p_n) \\equiv-\\sum_{x} p_x\\log p_x  Where \\log is base 2, meaning the entropy is measured in ‘bits’.\nConditional Entropy and Mutual Information\nThe joint entropy of a pair of random variables X and Y is defined H(X, Y) = -\\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \\log p(x,y) The joint entropy measures the total uncertainty about the pair (X,Y) . Suppose we know the value of Y, so we have acquired H(Y) bits of information about the pair. The remaining uncertainty about the pair is associated with the remaining lack of knowledge about X, therefore the entropy of X conditional on knowing Y is H(X|Y)\\equiv H(X, Y) - H(Y)\nThe mutual information content of X and Y measures how much information X and Y have in common. Suppose we add the information content of X, H(X), to the information content of Y. Information which is common to X and Y will have been counted twice in this sum, while information not common will have been counted once. Subtracting off the joint information of the pair (X, Y), H(X,Y), we obtain the mutual information of X and Y H(X:Y) \\equiv H(X) + H(Y) - H(X, Y)Note the useful equality H(X:Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) relating the conditional entropy and mutual information.\nVon Neumann Entropy\nQuantum states are described in a similar fashion, with density operators replacing probability distributions. Von Neumann defined the entropy of a quantum state \\rho by the formula S(\\rho) \\equiv-\\text{Tr}(\\rho\\log\\rho) where the \\log is again base 2. If \\lambda_x are the eigenvalues of \\rho, then the Von Neumann definition is also S(\\rho) = - \\sum_{x} \\lambda_x \\log\\lambda_x \nQuantum Relative Entropy\nSuppose we have \\rho and \\sigma as two density operators, the relative entropy of \\rho and \\sigma is defined by S(\\rho || \\sigma) \\equiv \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\log\\rho) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho\\log\\sigma) \nKlein’s Inequality\nTheorem:\nThe quantum relative entropy is non-negative S(\\rho||\\sigma)\\geq 0with equality iff \\rho = \\sigma\nMeasurements and Entropy\nThe effect of measurements on the entropy depends on the type of measurements we make. Suppose for example a projective measurements described by the projectors P_i is performed on a quantum system, but we never learn the result of the measurement. If the state of the system before the measurement was \\rho then the state after is given by \\rho&#039; = \\sum_i P_i \\rho P_i\nTheorem: Projective measurements increase entropy\nSuppose P_i is a complete set of orthogonal projectors and \\rho is the density operator. Then the entropy of the state \\rho&#039; = \\sum_i P_i \\rho P_i of the system after the measurement  is at least as great as the original entropy S(\\rho&#039;) \\geq S(\\rho)  with equality iff \\rho = \\rho&#039;."},"Physics/Quantum-Information/Stabilizer-Codes":{"slug":"Physics/Quantum-Information/Stabilizer-Codes","filePath":"Physics/Quantum Information/Stabilizer Codes.md","title":"Stabilizer Codes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Pauli group G_n for a single qubit it is defined G_1 \\equiv\\{\\pm I, \\pm i I, \\pm X, \\pm i X, \\pm Y, \\pm i Y, \\pm Z, \\pm i Z \\}and for n qubits is all n-fold tensor products of Pauli matrices with multiplicative factors \\pm 1 and \\pm i to ensure the elements are closed under multiplication.\nSuppose S is a subgroup of the Pauli group G_n, and define V_S to be the set of n qubit states which are fixed by every element of S (eigenvalue 1). V_S is the vector space stabilized by S, and S is said to be the stabilizer of the space V_S.\nA group is described by generators. A set of elements g_1, \\cdots, g_l in a group G is said to generate the group G if every element of G can be written as a product of elements from the list g_1, \\cdots, g_l, and we write G=\\langle g_1, \\cdots, g_l \\rangle.\nUnitary gates and the stabilizer formalism\nSuppose we apply a unitary U to a vector space V_S stabilized by the group S, then for any element g of S U|\\psi\\rangle= Ug|\\psi\\rangle = UgU^{\\dagger}Y|\\psi\\rangle  The state U|\\psi\\rangle is stabilized by UgU^{\\dagger}, and the vector space UV_S is stabilized by the group USU^{\\dagger}\\equiv \\{UgU^{\\dagger}|g\\in S \\}.

To see how unitary affects stabilizer, we only need to compute how it affects the generators of the stabilizer.\nFor special unitary operations U, this transformation of the generators takes simple form. Suppose we apply a Hadamard gate to a single qubit. Note HXH^{\\dagger};\\ \\ HYH^{\\dagger} = -Y; \\ \\ HZH^{\\dagger}=X  As a consequence we deduce that after a Hadamard gate is applied to the state stabilized by Z|0\\rangle, the resulting state will be stabilized by X|+\\rangle.\nClifford Gate\nClifford gates are the elements of the Clifford group, a set of transformations which normalize the n-qubit Pauli group. Any unitary operations taking elements of G_n to elements of G_n can be composed from the Hadamard, phase, and C-NOT gates. By definition, the set of U such that UG_n U^{\\dagger} = G_n is the normalizer of G_n, and is denoted by N(G_n).\nTheorem: Suppose U is any unitary operator on n qubits with the property that if g\\in G_n , then UgU^{\\dagger}\\in G_n. Then up to a global phase, U may be composed from \\mathcal{O}(n^2) Hadamard, phase, and C-NOT gates.\nEach Pauli gate is trivially an element of the Clifford group.\nMeasurement in the stabilizer formalism\nImagine we make a measurement of g\\in G_n. We assume without loss of generality that g is a product of Pauli matrices with no multiplicative factor of -1 or \\pm i out front. The system is assumed to be in state |\\psi\\rangle with stabilizer \\langle g_1, \\cdots, g_n \\rangle. The stabilizer of the state transforms under measurement in two ways\n\nMeasurement g commutes with all generators of the stabilizer\nMeasurement g anti-commutes with one or more of the generators of the stabilizer. Suppose g anti-commutes with g_1, without loss of generality we may assume g commutes with g_2, \\cdots, g_n since if it does not commute with one of these elements say g_2 then it will commute with g_1g_2, and we simply replace the generator g_2 by g_1g_2\n\nIn case 1, either g or -g is an element of the stabilizer since g_j g |\\psi \\rangle = gg_j |\\psi \\rangle = g|\\psi\\rangle , g|\\psi\\rangle \\in V_s and is a multiple of |\\psi\\rangle. If +g is in the stabilizer, then g|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle and measurement of g yields +1 with probability one, and the measurement does not disturb the state of the system and leaves the stabilizer invariant.\nIn case 2, when g anti-commutes with g_1 and commutes with all other generators. g has eigenvalues \\pm 1 so the projectors for the measurement outcomes \\pm 1 are given by (I\\pm g)/2, respectively, and the measurement probabilities are given by \\begin{align} p(+1) &amp;= \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{I+g}{2} |\\psi \\rangle \\langle\\psi|\\right)  \\\\ p(-1) &amp;= \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{I-g}{2} |\\psi \\rangle \\langle\\psi|\\right) \\end{align} Since g_1 |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle and gg_1 = - g_1 g then \\begin{align}p(+1) &amp;= \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{I+g}{2} g_1\\right) |\\psi \\rangle \\langle\\psi|  \\\\ &amp;= \\text{Tr}\\left(g_1 \\frac{I-g}{2} \\right) |\\psi \\rangle \\langle\\psi| \\end{align} Applying the cyclic property of the trace, we may take g_1 to the right hand end of the trace and absorb it into \\langle \\psi | using g_1 = g_1^{\\dagger}, giving p(+1) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{I-g}{2} |\\psi \\rangle \\langle\\psi\\right) = p(-1) Thus p(+1) = p(-1) = 1/2. Suppose the result +1 occurs, then the system is in state |\\psi^{+}\\rangle \\equiv (I+g) |\\psi\\rangle / \\sqrt{2} which has stabilizer \\langle g, g_2, \\cdots, g_n \\rangle. Similarly, if the result -1 occurs the posterior state is stabilized by \\langle -g, g_2, \\cdots, g_n\\rangle.\nThe Gottesman-Knill theorem\nTheorem: Suppose a quantum computation is performed which involves only the following elements: state preparations in the computational basis, Hadamard gates, phase gates, C-NOT gates, Pauli gates, and measurements of observables in the Pauli group, together with the possibility of classical control conditioned on the outcome of such measurements. Such a computation may be efficiently simulated on a classical computer.\nThe way a classical computer performs the simulation is simply to keep track of the generators of the stabilizer as the various operations are being performed in the computation. For example, to simulate a Hadamard gate we simply update each of the n generators describing the quantum state. Similarly, simulation of the state preparation, phase gate, C-NOT gate, Pauli gates, and measurements of observables in the Pauli group may all be done using \\mathcal{O}(n^2) steps on a classical computer, so that a quantum computation involving m operations from this set can be simulated using \\mathcal{O}(n^2m) operations on a classical computer.

They effectively are related to a given Bloch energy eigenstate through a Fourier transform\n\\begin{align}\n|w_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle &amp;= \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{BZ} e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\\ |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle d^3k \\\\\n|\\psi_{n, \\vec{k}} \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_{\\vec{R}}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\\ |w_{n, \n\\vec{k}} \\rangle\n\\end{align}\nAs long as the Bloch eigenstates are a smooth function of \\vec{k}, then the Wannier representation decays rapidly with |\\vec{r} -\\vec{R}|  for some given \\vec{R} associated with the Wannier state.\nThe Fourier transform is a special case of a unitary transformation, so we can view the Bloch and Wannier functions as providing two different bases describing the same manifold of states associated with an energy band. Another way of saying this is that the projector onto band n is unitarily equivalent,\n\\mathcal{P}_n = \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{BZ} |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle\\langle \\psi_{n\\vec{k}}| d^3k = \\sum_{\\vec{R}} |w_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle \\langle w_{n\\vec{k}}|\nMultiple Bands\nThe assumption that the Bloch eigenstates are smooth and periodic in \\vec{k} is based on the assumption that there are no degeneracies. However this is uncommon, there are typically degeneracies at high-symmetry points in the BZ. We can instead consider a group of J ordered bands that are separated by a finite energy gap from other bands. In insulators, the set of bands non-degenerate with the complementary set of bands will typically be the occupied band subspace. What we then seek is a set of J Wannier functions spanned by the J Bloch eigenstates constructed as,\n|w_{n,\\vec{R}}\\rangle = \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int_{BZ}e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\n|\\tilde{\\psi}_{n, \\vec{k}}\\rangle\\  d^3k\nwhere the |\\tilde{\\psi}_{n, \\vec{k}}\\rangle are smooth functions of \\vec{k} everywhere in the BZ that are related to the true Bloch energy eigenstates via a unitary transform\n|\\tilde{\\psi}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{m=1}^{J}U_{mn}(\\vec{k})|\\psi_{m, \\vec{k}}\\rangle\nThe manifold of J \\times J unitary matrices U_{mn}(\\vec{k}) have been chosen to “iron out” the non-analytic behavior near the degeneracies at high symmetry points. Then, the Wannier functions will be exponentially localized. The cell-periodic wavefunctions |u_{n,\\vec{k}}\\rangle transform in the same way as the Bloch eigenstates,\n|\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{m=1}^{J} U_{mn}(\\vec{k}) |u_{m\\vec{k}}\\rangle\nThis is known as a multiband or non-Abelian gauge transformation. It is not obvious whether this procedure is always possible. It can always be accomplished in localized region around some \\vec{k_0}, where we choose a set |\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle of orthonormal functions spanning the band subspace of H_{\\vec{k_0}}, being either the eigenstates themselves or some unitary rotation of them. We then choose at each nearby \\vec{k} a unitary rotation on the energy eigenstates |u_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle  such that they are “optimally aligned” with |\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k_0}}\\rangle.\nOptimal Alignment\nGiven two sets of orthonormal sets of J  states |u_n\\rangle and |\\nu_n\\rangle, where the subspaces  \\mathcal{P}_u = \\sum |u_n\\rangle \\langle u_n | and \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu} = \\sum |\\nu_n\\rangle \\langle \\nu_n| spanned by these states are similar but not identical. We would like to rotate one set such that they are as similar to the other as possible in both phase and character.\nOptimal alignment occurs when\n\\tilde{M}_{mn} = \\langle u_m| \\tilde{v}_n \\rangle\nis as close to the unit matrix as possible. Initially, before the unitary rotation,\nM_{mn} = \\langle u_m | \\nu_n \\rangle\nWe then perform a SVD on M\nM = V\\Sigma W^{\\dagger}\nwhere V and W are J\\times J unitary matrices and \\Sigma_{mn} = s_n \\delta_{nm} is a diagonal matrix whose elements s_n \\in \\mathcal{R} \\gt 0 are called “singular values”. One can show that if we apply V to the set of states \\{ |u_n\\rangle \\} and W to the set of states \\{ |\\nu_n\\rangle \\} we get new states\n\\begin{align}\n|u&#039;_n \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_m V_{mn} |u_m\\rangle \\\\\n|\\nu&#039;_n \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_m W_{mn} |\\nu_m\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nthat are optimally aligned in the sense that\nM&#039; = \\langle u&#039;_m | \\nu&#039;_n \\rangle = s_n \\delta_{mn}\nThe extent to which s_n \\lt 1 is a measure of the difference between \\mathcal{P}_u and \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu}. Since we are given |u_n\\rangle and they shouldn’t be rotated, we apply V^{\\dagger} to both sets, returning |u&#039;_n \\rangle back to |u_n\\rangle and\n|\\tilde{\\nu}_n\\rangle = \\sum_m (WV^{\\dagger})_{mn} | \\nu_m \\rangle\nwhich are in optimal alignment with the initial |u_n\\rangle. We also can think about the procedure as constructing the best unitary approximation to M\n\\mathcal{M} = VW^{\\dagger}\nthat tells us how the states |u_n\\rangle got rotated in going to the |\\nu_n\\rangle. We then apply the h.c. to undo this rotation. If any of the s_n = 0 than there is a subspace of vectors in \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu} that are orthogonal to the space spanned by \\mathcal{P}_u so they can’t be aligned.\nProjection method\nThe procedure of optimal alignment works locally in k but whether there is always a way to do this globally is highly non-trivial. One way of practically constructing multiband Wannier functions is via the projection method.\n\nChoose a set of J localized “trial functions” |t_n \\rangle whose locations and characters are similar to the expected Wannier functions\nExpand this set of functions to include periodic images |t_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle and construct Bloch like functions |\\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\vec{R}} e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}} |t_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle that are smooth in \\vec{k}\nOrthonormalize them at each \\vec{k} via computing the overlap matrix S^{(\\vec{k})}_{mn} = \\langle \\chi_{m\\vec{k}} | \\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle and construct |\\chi&#039;_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_m (S_{\\vec{k}}^{-1/2})_{mn} |\\chi_{m \\vec{k}}\\rangle\nPerform J\\times J unitary rotation on the |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle so as to obtain |\\tilde{\\psi}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle that are optimally aligned with the |\\chi&#039;_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle using the optimal alignment\nFor some choices of trial functions, |\\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle are not linearly independent and S_{\\vec{k}} becomes singular and the procedure fails. For ordinary insulators, the procedure can be fixed via a new choice of trial function. In certain kinds of topological insulators, there can be a topological obstruction; in this case a singularity in S_{\\vec{k}} is gauranteed to occur somewhere in the BZ.\n\nLocalization\nWannier interpolation"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Welcome to my digitial garden! 🪴🌱","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nThis page is where I keep my notes.
